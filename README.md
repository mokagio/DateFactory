An n-framework for creating `NSDate`, to be used in your unit tests.

## What's an _n-framework_?

It's a framework even smaller than a Î¼-framework, which you should consider
using by **copying it's single source and tests files** in your project rather
than going through the trouble of using a dependency manager.

## Why did you make this?

Two reasons:

- I wanted an easier way to create fixture `NSDate` in my tests than
using `NSDateFormatter`.
- I wanted to experiment with multiplaform framework, SPM, etc, in a small project.
